# coding-java-task
Coding task (JAVA)
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar 
spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each 
customer per month and total.
## Checklist
1. Goal of the assignment: showcase great craftsmanship skills in area of JAVA, services, testing, 
building readable, maintainable, resilient systems. If you have personal project (comparable in 
complexity) that you would like to present instead of the assignment – let us know.
2. Key elements: tests, good coding practices, well thought-out design – if requirements change 
your code should be easily fixable. Your assignment solution should not contain shortcuts that 
violate good coding practices e.g. class having multiple responsibilities; magic numbers in code; 
methods, variables names not giving any clue what they are for; etc.
3. Time required: anywhere between 3-6h depending on proficiency. It’s best to focus on solving 
the problem first with appropriate tests and benefit from features of recent versions of language 
and frameworks (autogenerate boilerplate code) to complete the assignment quickly. Check “key 
elements” that are evaluated.
4. Technical guidelines: 
   - Used libraries should be up to date (for example: Junit5 not 4, Spring boot 2.6.* not 
1.5.*).
   - Code should be clean, nice formatted, easy to read and understand.
   - Code must compile and run, there should be an instruction in readme.md file how to 
run the application.
   - All errors should be handled with appropriate http status codes (200, 400, 422, 500 
etc.) and with human readable message.
   - Points calculation logic should be separated from infrastructure (REST, DB) and should 
be easy to test with unit tests.
   - Please show the ability to write testable code. It is important.
   - Unit tests for points calculation logic should be written (please remember about corner 
cases).
   - Integration tests should not only check if application starts but also call REST endpoints 
and check at least if http status code is correct
   - Use of appropriate logging levels, framework
